## Herdr

[Herdr](https://herdr.dev) config lives in [`herdr/config.toml`](herdr/config.toml) and is symlinked into `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`, so herdr updates can't silently wipe customizations — any drift shows up in `git status`.

```bash
./herdr/apply.sh   # backup existing file, symlink, validate, reload
```

Notable customizations (herdr >= 0.8.2):

- `theme.custom.active_row_bg` — makes the current repo/branch row visible in the left pane (the old `surface_dim` override stopped working in 0.8.2, which switched active rows to this dedicated key)
- `theme.custom.teal` — turns the "agent waiting for you" indicator red

## Herdr app

The [Herdr app](https://herdr.dev/core/) (herdr-core desktop window) keeps its layout and mods in `~/.config/herdr-app`. The customized ones live in [`herdr-app/`](herdr-app/) as copies, not symlinks: the app rewrites the layout file as the window is used.

```bash
./herdr-app/sync.sh backup   # ~/.config/herdr-app -> herdr-app/ (run after changing a mod or the layout)
./herdr-app/sync.sh apply    # herdr-app/ -> ~/.config/herdr-app (replaced files go to ~/.config/herdr-app.bak-<time>-<pid>/)
```

Both copy only the mods and files named in `sync.sh` (`mods`, `files`, plus copy-on-select and the Catppuccin themes on `apply`); any other mod in `~/.config/herdr-app` is neither backed up nor replaced.

After a first `apply`, restart Herdr (it sees new mod folders at start) and pick the `main-dev` layout with ⌘⇧L.

- `layouts/main-dev.json` — clone of the shipped `main` layout; its spaces block points to `better-spaces`, its agents block to `agents-dev`, its Files block to `files-dev`, its Changes slot to `better-changes`, its tab bar to `tabs-dev`, and its side panel (`panel-body`) has a third block, `graph`, for `git-graph`. Its theme is Catppuccin: `herdr-catppuccin` (Mocha) in dark mode, `herdr-catppuccin-latte` in light mode
- `mods/spaces-dev` — dev server ports under each space (`🧑 fe:3011 · be:5010`, `🤖` for agent-started servers), read from the files `herdr-dev.sh watch` writes (see `scripts/projects/fullstack-multi-repo/`); patch: `ports.js` and lines marked `dev ports`. Replaced in the layout by `better-spaces` and kept as the fallback
- `mods/better-spaces` — [munza/herdr-mods](https://github.com/munza/herdr-mods/tree/main/better-spaces) at `77d94f7` (branch right-aligned on the space row, worktrees nested, PR status from `gh`), in the spaces block. Patched with the same `dev ports` line (`ports.js` and lines marked `dev ports`), and `updateColors` waits up to 2 s after a start for the shared `space.colors` (marked `space colors`): without that its first tick recolored every space. It runs `git`, `hc` and `gh` (GitHub with your local `gh` login). A space whose first terminal is in a non-repo folder (a workbranch wrapper) shows no branch or PR. Also merged in: the agent status glows of [filipores/herdr-spaces-status](https://github.com/filipores/herdr-spaces-status) at `4881e68` (green done, orange blocked, a breathing neutral contour while an agent works; `navigation.js` and lines marked `status glow`; commands `better-spaces.first_done` and `better-spaces.next_working`, no keys bound), Apache-2.0 ([`LICENSE-herdr-spaces-status`](herdr-app/LICENSE-herdr-spaces-status), [`NOTICE-herdr-spaces-status`](herdr-app/NOTICE-herdr-spaces-status)). Its own `spaces-glow` mod isn't installed: it replaces the same Spaces block and would drop the branch, PR and port lines. The active space row is tinted cyan (`#22d3ee`), with a cyan bar on the left and its name in bold (marked `current highlight`): the plain selected background looked like the status outlines, most space colors are green or teal like the done glow, and yellow sat too close to the blocked orange
- `mods/agents-dev` — "Grouped by space" headers with the space's colored letter, bold name, separators and git branch; patch marked `space headers`. Until a sort is picked it groups by space (the shipped default is Priority, which has no space headers); the pick is kept by the app, not in this repo. Each agent row also gets the Spaces list's status glow (green done, orange blocked, breathing contour while working; marked `status glow`), and the focused agent's row the same cyan highlight (marked `current highlight`). Under a space header each agent row, and its sub-terminal rows, steps in 22px (the header's avatar and gap, the depth the Spaces list nests a worktree at), so the space reads as the heading and its agents as the items under it; pinned and priority rows, which name their space themselves, stay at the edge (marked `nested rows`; the `NEST` constant sets the depth)
- `mods/files-dev` — clone of the shipped Files panel (0.1.12). It publishes the file its preview shows as the shared `files-dev.shown`, so the tab bar's **Markdown** button can render it, and while that Markdown viewer tab is the shown one it keeps listing the folder the file came from instead of jumping to the space folder (marked `markdown tab`; `markdown.js` is the same file as in `tabs-dev`)
- `mods/changes-dev` — in a workbranch wrapper folder (not a repo, repos right under it such as `backend/` and `frontend/`) a repo picker with per-repo change counts; commits go to the picked repo; patch marked `wrapper repos`
- `mods/better-changes` — [munza/herdr-mods](https://github.com/munza/herdr-mods/tree/main/better-changes) at `77d94f7` (staged/unstaged groups with stage buttons, tree/flat list, inline/side-by-side diff in one reusable tab), in the Changes slot. Patched with the same `wrapper repos` repo picker (it commits staged changes of the picked repo only), and `mod.json` `place` is `none` so it doesn't also dock a second right sidebar. The commit message is a text area (3 to 8 rows) with the buttons under it (marked `commit box`). A sparkle button beside Commit asks an AI for the message from the staged diff and the last 8 commit messages, keeping the repo's prefix form and language (marked `ai message`; `sparkle.svg`, `AI_COMMAND` and `AI_EXAMPLES` at the top of `main.js`, `aiPrompt` and `aiMessage` in `model.js`): it runs `claude -p` with no tools and the `sonnet` model, so the staged diff goes to Anthropic through your Claude Code login; change `AI_COMMAND` for codex or grok. `markdown.js` (marked `markdown tab`, the same file as in `tabs-dev`) keeps the panel on the repo it was on while the Markdown viewer tab is shown. `changes-dev` stays installed: put it back in the layout's `changes` block to switch.
- `mods/tabs-dev` — clone of the shipped tab bar whose `+` button opens `herdr-open-with-zed` (one row taller, 543px); patch marked `open with zed`. Each tab is at least 180px wide, so a short name is still easy to click, with the status dot and close button at its right edge (marked `tab width`). A tab with an agent in any of its panes is tinted yellow (`#facc15`), the color that stands out most since agent tabs matter most, while other tabs keep the theme's grey and are always outlined in the theme's foreground at 25% (40% when active, also filled), since the shipped tab bar draws inactive tabs as bare text and the theme's own border color almost vanishes against the bar (marked `tab kind`). A **Git** button beside Files and Changes opens `git-graph` in the same side panel (marked `git graph`; the panel's `graph` block is in `layouts/main-dev.json`). A **Markdown** button renders the Markdown file the open panel is on (Files' preview, or the file picked in Changes) in a `markdown-browser` tab in the center, one per space, switched in place on the next click and lit while that tab is shown; it stays dim until a Markdown file is picked (marked `markdown browser`; `markdown.js`, shared `markdown-tab.tabs`, `markdown-browser.show` and `markdown-browser.slots`). Left of `+`, a 3-column | 2-column switch: 2 columns zooms the shown tab's agent pane (else its focused pane) so the shell column folds away and the file panel keeps its room, also when switching tabs; 3 columns unzooms only the panes it zoomed, never one zoomed by hand (marked `view mode`; `columns-3.svg`, `columns-2.svg`, shared `tabs-dev.view` and `tabs-dev.view-zoomed`)
- `mods/herdr-open-with-zed` — [atleugim/herdr-open-with-zed](https://github.com/atleugim/herdr-open-with-zed) at `a15570e`, unchanged: Herdr's `+` menu (`new-menu` 0.1.11) with an **Open with Zed** row that opens the focused terminal's folder in Zed (`zed`, else `zeditor`, else `open -a Zed`). Apache-2.0 ([`LICENSE-herdr-open-with-zed`](herdr-app/LICENSE-herdr-open-with-zed)); after a Herdr update changes `new-menu`, copy its `main.js` again and re-add the row
- `mods/git-graph` — [rabeeh-ta/herdr-git-graph](https://github.com/rabeeh-ta/herdr-git-graph) at `2226f57` (v0.3.0), unchanged: a commit graph of the focused terminal's repository after VS Code's Git Graph (colored lanes, branch/remote/tag labels, an uncommitted row, commit details and diffs; double-click a branch to check it out, right-click for checkout, merge, rebase, cherry pick, revert, reset, tag, branch, push, commit and stash, each asking first in a dialog), and in a folder of repositories (a workbranch wrapper) a Manygit list of them with branch, uncommitted count and ahead/behind. Opened from the tab bar's **Git** button into the side panel's `graph` block. It runs `git`, and for Manygit `find` and `env`; git reaches the network only on Fetch, Fetch all, Pull, Push or deleting a remote branch, and the mod itself asks GitHub's public releases API once a day for a newer release (**Stop checking** in its update window, or `CHECK = false` in `update.js`, turns that off). Herdr stops a command after 30 s, so a slow fetch or push can fail there. MIT ([`LICENSE-herdr-git-graph`](herdr-app/LICENSE-herdr-git-graph)); its icons follow Lucide, ISC (`mods/git-graph/icons/LICENSE-lucide.txt`). To update it, copy `mods/git-graph/` from that repo again: nothing here patches it
- `mods/markdown-browser` — [ohneda/herdr-markdown-browser](https://github.com/ohneda/herdr-markdown-browser) at `bb1f3c7`: a native Markdown preview pane (Herdr's `TextView.markdown`, so no images or Mermaid), reloaded when the file changes, with a **Default app** button and `⌘⇧O` (its `mod:markdown-browser` section is merged into `keys.json`) for the system's default `.md` app. Used here only as the viewer the tab bar's **Markdown** button opens; its own Markdown list panel isn't in the layout. The one change: `mod.json` `place` is `none`, so it doesn't dock a column at the window's right edge. It reads the previewed file and watches its folder; opening in the default app runs `sh` with `realpath` and `open`; its list (unused here) would run `git rev-parse`, `git ls-files` or `find`; no network. MIT ([`LICENSE-herdr-markdown-browser`](herdr-app/LICENSE-herdr-markdown-browser)). To update it, copy `mods/markdown-browser/` from that repo again and set `place` to `none`
- `settings.json`, `keys.json` — app look and keys; `keys.json` also carries markdown-browser's `mod:markdown-browser` section (`⌘⇧O`)
- copy-on-select ([jspoynor/herdr-copy-on-select](https://github.com/jspoynor/herdr-copy-on-select)) — copies a terminal selection on mouse release; it has no license, so `apply` downloads it at a pinned commit instead of keeping a copy here
- Catppuccin themes ([MarcozVD/herdr-layout-catppuccin](https://github.com/MarcozVD/herdr-layout-catppuccin)) — `themes/herdr-catppuccin.json` and `themes/herdr-catppuccin-latte.json`, with a sky-blue `#60b9fc` accent; no license, so `apply` downloads them at `b58f434` and checks each sha256. Only the themes: that repo's `catppuccin` layout swaps the tab bar, spaces, agents and changes blocks for its own mods, which would drop the patches above. A theme picked in Settings > Look is kept per layout in `layouts/.state/`; pick the Catppuccin themes there again if one was picked before

The `-dev` mods are `mod.clone`s of Herdr's own mods (version 0.1.11, `files-dev` 0.1.12, recorded as `cloned_from` in each `mod.json`), licensed Apache-2.0 ([`LICENSE-herdr`](herdr-app/LICENSE-herdr)). Clones get no Herdr updates: after an update changes a shipped mod, clone it again and re-apply the marked patch. `markdown.js` is one file kept in `tabs-dev`, `files-dev` and `better-changes`: change all three together.

`better-changes` and `better-spaces` are Apache-2.0 ([`LICENSE-herdr-mods`](herdr-app/LICENSE-herdr-mods), [`NOTICE-herdr-mods`](herdr-app/NOTICE-herdr-mods)). To update one, copy `<name>/mods/<name>/` from that repo and re-apply its marked patch (and for `better-changes` the `place` change).

## mco

[mco](https://github.com/mco-org/mco) workflow helpers live in [`mco/mco-workflow.zsh`](mco/mco-workflow.zsh), symlinked to `~/.mco-workflow.zsh` and sourced from `~/.zshrc`.

```bash
./mco/apply.sh   # backup existing file, symlink, add source line to ~/.zshrc
```

Workflow: spec → 접근안 수집 (mco) → plan 작성 (claude) → plan review (mco) → plan 보강 (claude) → 구현 (mco) → 구현 리뷰 (mco). Providers are always the first argument.

```bash
mco-plan-draft claude,codex,grok plans/auth.spec.md   # independent short approaches -> plans/auth.drafts.md
mco-plan-review codex,grok plans/auth.md              # plan review + debate -> plans/auth.debate.md
mco-code-impl codex plans/auth.md                     # implement (write mode)
mco-code-review codex,grok main --plan plans/auth.md  # review git diff vs base ref (default: main)
```

`-n` = dry-run; other `--xxx` flags pass through to mco. File args accept a partial name (`insight`, `insight precedence`): one match runs directly, several open fzf (terminal) or list candidates (non-interactive). Artifacts go to `reports/mco/<task-id>/`.
